# team-assignment
The first part of our group assignment. Our web application will be a Christmas movie database including two tables (movie and director)

The movie table consists of six fields which are: movie_ID (PK), director_id (FK), movie_year, movie_name, rating (ex: G, PG, PG-13, etc.) and genre

The director table consists of four fields, including: director_id (PK), first_name, last_name and dob

The relationships amongst the tables for the database are the following: A Movie is directed by one and only one director, but a director can direct one-to-many movies.
